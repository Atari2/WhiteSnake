Function purpose and definitions:
    -> create_spr_macro(addr, name)
        this function will create a macro that just JSLs to addr specified
        with the name specified, in reality the macro will be just a formatted
        string, this macro will also add PHB : PLB before the JSL as sprite code
        will destroy the bank to read from tables correctly
    -> create_macro(addr, name)
        this function will do the same as the previously explained one, except that
        it WON'T preserve the bank
    -> create_shared_patch()
        this will create a shared_patch.asm file that will be applied to the rom
        it will insert all global routines defined in the routines folder
        except for the ones that start with '__'
    -> copy_rom(rom, rom_backup)
        pretty self explanatory, creates a backup of the rom in case things go south
    -> clean_old_pointers(rom)
        this function will autoclean the pointers in the rom, if there's any
        (checks for the existance of autoclean pointers by checking if there's a file
        with the proper name in the working folder)
    -> apply_shared_patch(rom)
        this will apply the aforementioned shared_patch, will throw PatchException and revert
        changes on the rom in case of failure
    -> create_autoclean()
        it's a multi purpose function that will create autoclean files for both sprites and global routines
    -> add_asm_to_sprites()
        this function will copy all the sprites from the original folder, then it will apply some modification
        (like bank->K and a JSL to the sprite table init routine).
    -> create_shared_sprites()
        this will add 'freecode cleaned' and all the incsrc necessary to all copied sprite files
    -> get_spr_pointers(romname)
        this will apply the sprites to your rom (will revert back if failed), and it will also create a file with
        the pointers to the sprites, so they can be autocleaned in the next run of the script
    -> prepare_uberasm_file()
        will make a uberasm file with all the necessary calls to have your sprites functional
    -> remove_temp_files(rom_backup)
        will, I mean, remove all temp files
