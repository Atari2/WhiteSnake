The 3 byte SNES pointer for the list can be found at 0x7775D PC in the ROM. If the pointer is 0 or 0xFFFFFF, no custom sprites are present on the overworld. Lunar Magic manages the table on its own and will delete, change or relocate it when needed, so keep this in mind.

The table format is fairly close to the one in Lui37's patch, and would point to sprite_data (see below). The difference for Lunar Magic is that sprite_data has 2 byte offsets rather than pointers. Up to 0x18 sprites per submap are supported.

macro spr(id, x, y, z, extra)
	db <id>|((<x>&1)<<7)
	db (<x>>>1)|((<y>&7)<<5)
	db (<y>>>3)|(<z><<3)
	db <extra>
endmacro

;Note: for LM these are offsets instead
sprite_data:
	dw .MainMap - sprite_data
	dw .YoshisIsland - sprite_data
	dw .VanillaDome - sprite_data
	dw .ForestOfIllusion - sprite_data
	dw .BowsersValley - sprite_data
	dw .SpecialWorld - sprite_data
	dw .StarWorld - sprite_data

.MainMap:
	dw $0000

.YoshisIsland:
	%spr(!some_id, !x, !y, !z, !extra)
	dw $0000

.VanillaDome:
	dw $0000

.ForestOfIllusion:
	dw $0000

.BowsersValley:
	dw $0000

.SpecialWorld:
	dw $0000

.StarWorld:
	dw $0000
Warning: Lunar Magic only inserts the table. It's up to you or a 3rd party utility to modify the game code or apply a patch to make use of it. If you don't, it won't actively harm anything but no custom sprites displayed by Lunar Magic's overworld editor will show up in the game.
